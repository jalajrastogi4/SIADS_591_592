# SIADS_591_592
In this project we performed EDA on public datasets provided by NASA. 
The dataset contains McCabe and Halstead metrics parameters which can be used to predict whether code is prone to errors and needs redesign or not. 
Based on guidelines provided by verisoft we narrowed down features and used RandomForestClassifier to create a model that can predict if a program needs to be redesigned.
